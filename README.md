## Running Scripts

You can run nushell scripts in a few different ways.

1. You can type `nu <script name>`.
2. From with nushell, you can type `source <script name>` and if the script is just a bunch of commands it will run the script. If the script is a custom command it will load those custom commands into your current scope so you can run them like any other command.
