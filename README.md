# Nushell Scripts

This is a place to share Nushell scripts with each other. If you'd like to share your scripts, create a PR that adds it to the repo.

## Running Scripts

You can run nushell scripts in a few different ways.

1. You can type `nu <script name>`.
2. From with nushell, you can type `source <script name>` and if the script is just a bunch of commands it will run the script. If the script is a custom command it will load those custom commands into your current scope so you can run them like any other command.
