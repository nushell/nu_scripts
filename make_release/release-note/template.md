# Full changelog

<!-- TODO:
    - `use nu_scripts/make_release/release-note/notes.nu *`
    - run `list-prs --milestone v{{VERSION}} | pr-table`
    - paste the output here

Afterwards, go through each PR and classify it as one of the following:
    - A user-facing change. These PRs should go into the `# Changes` section.
    - A plugin-facing change. These PRs should go in `# Notes for plugin developers`. Some plugin-facing changes might also be a user-facing change and vice versa.
    - A documentation improvement, error message improvement, refactoring PR, clippy fix, typo fix, etc. These PRs go into the `# Hall of fame`. You can just copy the table row in this section and paste it to the `# Hall of fame` section above. Note that major refactorings may warrant a section in `# Highlights`.
    - Dependabot PRs and version bumps should be ignored. They will only be mentioned in `# Full changelog`.
