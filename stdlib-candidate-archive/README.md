# std-lib candidate is deprecated

Going forward, `std-rfc` will be included in the main Nushell release,
just like `std` is.  This will allow users to more easily try-out its potential
new commands and features.

Please contribute new `std` proposals to the main Nushell repository.

See that [README](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/crates/nu-std/std-rfc/README.md)
for more information on how to contribute.

## Removal

This directory will be preserved for some period during deprecation, but no new
contributions are expected to be accepted. Any remaining items from
the older (pre-December 2024) `stdlib-candidate-old` should be identified for transition
to `std-rfc`, since at some point we expect to delete this directory.
