This is a place to share nushell scripts with each other. If you'd like to share your scripts, create a PR that adds it to the repo.

## Running Scripts

You can run Nushell scripts in a few different ways.

1. You can type `nu <script name>`.
2. From with nushell, you can type `source <script name>` and if the script is just a bunch of commands it will run the script. If the script is a custom command it will load those custom commands into your current scope so you can run them like any other command.

## Scripts

This is an automatically generated list of all the scripts in the repo.

{{scripts_list}}

<!-- TODO: Finish this part

### Help Improve This List

Most of these scripts don't have descriptions, it will be great if you could help out with adding descriptions to these scripts.

### Excluded scripts

Some scripts are excluded:

- Everything in the `before_v0.60` folder, this is because they are old and probably can't be used anymore.
- Everything in the `custom-completions\auto-generate\completions` folder, these scripts are completions that are autogenerated from fish shell completions. They are autogenerated and they are not considered as actual scripts.
