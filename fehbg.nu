# This script selects a random image from a directory and sets it as a
# wallpaper. An additional feature is that it draws the path of the image in
# the lower left corner which makes it easier to find the image later.
#
# The procedure is as follows::
# * Select a random image from a directory (recursively entering all
#   subdirectories)
# * Print the path of the image on top of the selected image
# * Save the result in a temporary file
# * Set the temporary image as a wallpaper.
#
# !! Requires `WALLPAPER_DIR` and `TMP_DIR` environment variables to be set !!
#    (or just hardcode your own paths below)
#
# You can set this script to run on desktop startup, e.g., by adding it to
# xinitrc.
#
# Dependencies;
