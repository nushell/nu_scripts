# Scripts and Source

This directory contains scripts and source files used to generate the `nu-themes` from their original sources.

## `make.nu`

Running `./make.nu` from inside the `src` directory will generate/update the main `nu-themes` directory.

Currently, two sources are used:

* The Lemnos Themes repository
* Custom Nushell themes located in the `custom-nu-themes` subdirectory

## Custom themes

Custom themes may be added to the `custom-nu-themes` directory.  Follow the existing examples.

## Screenshot Preview Scripts

The `preview-*.nu` scripts are used to generate the screenshot examples. These currently require a Windows system.  For instructions on usage, *"Use the Source, Luke"*. More documentation may be provided in a sequel.
