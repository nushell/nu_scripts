# cool oneliners

Capturing oneliners to and from the nushell community.

Consider these a living library.
Or an ongoing story of how people actually use `nu`.

## Naming and script requirements

- the filename should be an abbreviation of the general topic of the script
  For example:

  ```sh
  git_batch_extract.nu
  ```

- the script should have two lines
  - the first line should be a comment describing the script's purpose
  - the second line should be the cool oneliner
