# Selects one or more rows while keeping

#
# Example - Selects the first, fifth, and
# sixth rows from the table:
#
# ls / | select ranges 0 4..5
#
# Example - Select the 5th row:
#
# ls / | select 5
#
# Example - Select the 4th row.
# Note that the difference between this
# and `select 3` is that the index (#)
# column shows the *original* (pre-select)
# position in the table.
#
# ls | select ranges 3
