# This script will run a command, in this case get_weather, at a prescribed interval
# This is meant to be run from your prompt so that it runs every time you cd or
# run a command. Each time it will check if it's been longer than the interval and
# if so, run the command, otherwise it uses the cached weather information.
# I wrote this so I could have weather in my prompt but not pay the price of hitting
# the web for every prompt. It will need to be tweaked to actually be used in a
# prompt, but for now it just prints the weather in these 3 ways.
# 1. if it's never been run, it runs the weather command and saves the json cache info
# 2. if the interval has not expired yet, it prints the Cached information
# 3. if the interval has expired, it runs the weather command again and caches the info

# this script is depenedent on get-weather
