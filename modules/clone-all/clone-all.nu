# Generic fn to clone all repos of one organization into a specific folder
# 
# # Parameters
# `list_of_repos` is a list of <ORG/REPO> from github
#   for example:
# ```nu
# let list_of_repos = [
#     "nushell/nushell"
#     "nushell/nu_scripts"
#     "nushell/vscode-nushell-lang"
# ]
#
# and destination is the location where those repos are cloned
# $ use clone-all.nu *
# $ clone all ['nushell/nu_scripts'] /home/my-dir/
# equals
# gh repo clone nushell/nu_scripts /home/my-dir/nu_scripts
# (note that it doesn't create the organization folder)

# Clones all the `list_of_repos` into `destination` folder
