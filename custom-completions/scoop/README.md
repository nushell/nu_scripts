# Scoop Custom Completions

This script provides custom completions for [scoop](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop).
It can be used by importing its exported commands via:

```
use path/to/scoop/scoop-completions.nu *
```

With `path/to` being either the relative path of the file to your current working directory or its absolute path.
