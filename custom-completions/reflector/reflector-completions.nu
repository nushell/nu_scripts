	--threads: int 																	# Use n threads for rating mirrors. This option will speed up the rating step but the results will be inaccurate if the local bandwidth is saturated at any point during the operation. If rating takes too long without this option then you should probably apply more filters to reduce the number of rated servers before using this option.

	--delay: int 																		# Only return mirrors with a reported sync delay of n hours or less, where n is a float. For example. to limit the results to mirrors with  a reported delay of 15 minutes or less, pass 0.25.
	--country(-c): string 													# Restrict mirrors to selected countries. Countries may be given by name or country code, or a mix of both. The case is ignored. Multiple countries may be selected using commas (e.g. --country France,Germany) or by passing this option multiple times (e.g. -c fr -c de).

	--number(-n): int 															# Return at most n mirrors.
	--protocol(-p): string@"nu-complete protocol" 	# Match one of the given protocols, e.g. "https" or "ftp". Multiple protocols may be selected using commas (e.g. "https,http") or by passing this option multiple times.
