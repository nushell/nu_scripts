# Gradle Wrapper

`gradlew`, short for "Gradle Wrapper", is a script designed to provide a consistent and reliable way to build and run Gradle projects, regardless of the environment in which the project is being executed. This script ensures that the correct version of Gradle is used, even if Gradle is not installed on the host machine. It's really common to see a `gradlew` script in projects in JVM languages (Java, Kotlin, etc).
