# Nix Custom Completions

This script provides custom completions for the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/).
It encodes the full set of available subcommands and options.
It can be used by importing its exported commands via:

```
use path/to/nix-completions.nu *
```

With `path/to` being either the relative path of the file to your current working directory or its absolute path.
