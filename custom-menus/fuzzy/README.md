a few keybindings using the new `input list --fuzzy` command to interactively select what to do:
- `history.nu`: select a command from history
- `directories.nu`: select a directory, recursively from the current `PWD`
- `modules.nu`: recursively select and insert a `.nu` module from `NU_LIB_DIRS` inside a `use ...` command, ready to be run by pressing enter
