# Nushell standard library candidate scripts

### Definition

Standard library candidates are scripts that should be installed with nushell and be sourced at startup time that add additional functionality to nushell. Some of these scripts could even take the place of some of the current rust code.

### Why Candidate?

Since this is really the only documentation of what should be in a standard library for nushell, we need to decide as a community what needs to be included in a standard library.

### Category

Standard Library candidates can be any category of script.
